                <h2>The Story of Anne Frank</h2>
                <p>
                    The museum was once the home of Otto Frank’s business.  The famous Annex that housed Anne Frank while in hiding. It was located behind the wharehouse with the entrance being a moveable bookshelf. When the War came to Amsterdam the family had to hide in the secret annex behind Ottos office, so that they wouldnt be found by the Nazis. Anne Frank went into hiding with her parents, her sister, and four other people. They moved into the annex in 1942, and they were discovered and sent to concentration camps in 1944.
